  child: Text('About'),

  aboutBoxChildren: [
    Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 8.0),
      child: Text(
        'Built with Flutter',
        style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
      ),
    ),

  ],

  // dense: Whether this list tile is part of a vertically dense list.

Additional tips:
- To customize the appearance of the `AboutListTile`, you can adjust the theme of the application using ThemeData.
- If you have multiple licenses or additional information, you can include them as `aboutBoxChildren`.
- Ensure that the information provided in the about box is up-to-date and relevant to the application.
- Including a link to your website or social media handles can provide users with additional resources and information about your project.

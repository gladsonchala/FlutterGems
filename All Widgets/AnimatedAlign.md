## `AnimatedAlign` Widget
### Use the `AnimatedAlign` widget to create a widget that positions its child by an alignment that animates implicitly.

```dart
// AnimatedAlign Widget
// Use the AnimatedAlign widget to create a widget that positions its child by an alignment that animates implicitly.

AnimatedAlign(
  // Unique Key: Optional key to identify this widget.
  // key: Key('animated_align'),

  // alignment: The alignment of the child within the parent.
  alignment: Alignment.center,

  // child: The widget to align within the parent.
  child: Container(
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    color: Colors.blue,
  ),

  // heightFactor: The factor to apply to the child's height.
  heightFactor: 1.0,

  // widthFactor: The factor to apply to the child's width.
  widthFactor: 1.0,

  // curve: The curve to apply when animating the alignment.
  curve: Curves.easeInOut,

  // duration: The duration of the animation.
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),

  // onEnd: A callback function called when the animation ends.
  onEnd: () {
    // Perform actions after the animation ends.
  },
)
```

Additional tips:
- Use `AnimatedAlign` to animate the alignment of its child widget implicitly.
- Customize the alignment using the `alignment` property.
- Adjust the size of the child widget using `heightFactor` and `widthFactor`.
- Specify the animation curve using the `curve` property, and set the duration of the animation using the `duration` property.
- You can provide an `onEnd` callback to perform actions after the animation completes.

## `AssetBundle` Class

### Overview
The `AssetBundle` class represents a collection of resources, such as images, fonts, and other files, that can be loaded by an application. It is responsible for loading and managing these resources from the underlying asset storage.

### Usage
```dart
// AssetBundle
// Use the AssetBundle class to load and manage application resources.

AssetBundle assetBundle = DefaultAssetBundle.of(context);

// Example: Loading an image
Image image = Image(image: AssetImage('assets/image.png'));

// Example: Loading a font
TextStyle textStyle = TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Roboto');
```

### Explanation
- Use the `AssetBundle` class to access resources like images, fonts, and other files bundled with the application.
- You can obtain an `AssetBundle` instance using `DefaultAssetBundle.of(context)`.
- To load an image, use `AssetImage` with the path to the image file in the `assets` folder.
- To use a custom font, make sure it is included in the `pubspec.yaml` file and then specify the font family in the `TextStyle` using the font's name.

### Tips
- Always ensure that the assets you want to access are properly included in the `pubspec.yaml` file under the `flutter` section.
- Organize your assets into folders within the `assets` directory to maintain a clear structure.
- Use meaningful names for your assets to make them easy to manage and reference in your code.## `AssetBundle` Class

## `AnimatedOpacity` Widget
### Use the `AnimatedOpacity` widget to animate the opacity of its child implicitly.

```dart
// AnimatedOpacity Widget
// Use the AnimatedOpacity widget to animate the opacity of its child implicitly.

AnimatedOpacity(
  // Unique Key: Optional key to identify this widget.
  // key: Key('animated_opacity'),

  // child: The child widget whose opacity will be animated.
  child: YourChildWidget(),

  // opacity: The target opacity value to animate towards.
  opacity: 0.5,

  // curve: The curve to apply when animating the opacity.
  curve: Curves.easeInOut,

  // duration: The duration of the animation.
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),

  // onEnd: A callback function called when the animation ends.
  onEnd: () {
    // Perform actions after the animation ends.
  },

  // alwaysIncludeSemantics: Whether the semantics of the child are always included.
  alwaysIncludeSemantics: false,
)
```

Additional tips:
- Use `AnimatedOpacity` to animate the opacity of its child implicitly.
- Specify the target opacity using the `opacity` property.
- Customize the animation curve using the `curve` property, and set the duration of the animation using the `duration` property.
- You can provide an `onEnd` callback to perform actions after the animation completes.
- Set `alwaysIncludeSemantics` to true if the semantics of the child should always be included, regardless of the opacity value.

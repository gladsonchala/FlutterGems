## `Baseline` Widget

### Overview
The `Baseline` widget aligns its child based on the child's baseline. It's useful for aligning text or other widgets with different baseline heights.

### Usage
```dart
// Baseline Widget
// Use the Baseline widget to align its child based on the child's baseline.

Baseline(
  // Unique Key: Optional key to identify this widget.
  // key: Key('baseline'),

  // baseline: The distance between the top of the widget and the child's baseline.
  baseline: 20,

  // baselineType: The type of baseline to use for alignment.
  baselineType: TextBaseline.alphabetic,

  // child: The widget to be aligned based on the baseline.
  child: YourChildWidget(),
)
```

### Explanation
- Use the `Baseline` widget to align its child based on the child's baseline.
- The `baseline` property specifies the distance between the top of the widget and the child's baseline.
- The `baselineType` property determines the type of baseline to use for alignment, such as alphabetic or ideographic.
- The `child` property is the widget to be aligned based on the baseline.

### Tips
- Ensure that the child widget has a baseline specified or can be aligned using the specified baseline type.
- Use `TextBaseline.alphabetic` if aligning text or widgets with text, and `TextBaseline.ideographic` for other cases.
- Adjust the `baseline` value to achieve the desired vertical alignment for the child.
- Test the baseline alignment with different child widgets to ensure proper alignment across various scenarios.
